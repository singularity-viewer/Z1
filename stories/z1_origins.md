# Z1 Origin Story [collaboration between Liru and TysonTan]
One of the members of our Singularity Research Team (a white stoat),
was working late one night on Project Z1, a device created to establish
and contain a small localized singularity. He recalibrated the device
with his latest changes, started it up, put on his gear and went into
the observation room. Everything seemed to be working out well, and he
went to observe closer, the gravity pulled him in and the anomaly
collapsed around him, knocking him out. He came to the next day in
medical, during the event, the equipment took the brunt of the blow for
him, merging with his body from the force. He had become one with Z1,
and thus took on the more familial moniker Zoey. In time, he found he
could control the technology he'd fused with, and since it was his own
design he could also make modifications to the code. Using his
abilities, Zoey now creates the Singularity and does research by diving
straight into it, becoming a mink. Free to live on the wild side, taking
the riskier paths in this new exciting reality, free to go where he
would not dare in his normal life.
