## Appearance
Zoey has two forms:
- The researcher, a white stoat, who can typically be found wearing a lab-coat and spectacles.
- Z1, a dark mink in a black hoodie, with our teamâ€™s logo on a bow on the back of his head.

### Symbolism/Meaning
- The portal (an incarnation of our logo) represents the Singularity, through which you travel to enter other (virtual) worlds.
- The contrast between the forms represents the duality of the real life and the virtual one.
- The "Shh" gesture implies the stealth of the virtual reality identity. We chose a mink for their ability to dive into the pool of virtual reality.
